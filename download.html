<h2>Downloads</h2>
<p>Files to install Maxima can be downloaded from
the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/maxima/files/">Files
section</a> in the Sourceforge repository. That section contains links
to various different versions and releases of Maxima.</p>
<p>The section <a href="#releases">Recent Releases</a> (on the right
or at the bottom of this page) shows the most recent releases and
clicking on a release number will show the Change Log for it.</p>
<p>It is also possible to test Maxima without installing it, by using
a <a href="http://maxima.cesga.es/">Maxima online interface</a>.
</p>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>Read the section: <a href="windows-install.html">Installation of
Maxima in Windows</a></p>
<h3>Macintosh</h3>
<p>The most recent version can be found in the
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/maxima/files/Maxima-MacOS/">Maxima-MacOS
download section</a> and the <em>The MaximaList</em> blog has a good
<a href="https://themaximalist.org/about/my-mac-os-installation/">tutorial
to install Maxima in Mac OS</a>.</p>
<h3>Linux</h3>
<h4>Using a Linux package</h4>
<p>Most Linux distributions include a Maxima package that can be
installed with the package manager. Distributions based on .deb
packages will automatically install maxima on clicking
<a href="apt://maxima">this link</a>. Be aware that the complete
Maxima code might come split into several packages; some
functionalities might not work if some of those packages have not been
installed.</p>
<h3>Manually installing maxima on RPM based systems</h3>
<p>The
section <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/maxima/files/Maxima-Linux/">Maxima-Linux</a>
in the Sourceforge repository provides RPM packages created by the
Maxima developers. You can chose one of the files named:
<code>name-version.i386.rpm</code>, where the first part is the name
of each package and the second part are the numbers that identify the
version. The minimum set of packages that must be installed
are <em>maxima</em> and <em>maxima-exec-clisp</em>.  Since they both
depend on each other, they should be installed with a single rpm
command:</p>
<pre>rpm -ivh maxima-x.y.z-n.i386.rpm maxima-exec-clisp-x.y.z-n.i386.rpm</pre>
<p><strong>Clisp</strong> and <strong>Gnuplot</strong> should be
installed in your system.</p>
<p>You may also want to install <em>maxima-xmaxima</em>, which
provides the Xmaxima front-end and one of the graphic engines used by
some of Maxima's plotting commands.</p>
<p>The <em>maxima-lang</em> packages provide translations of the
manual into various languages, although none of those translations are
complete.</p>
<h3>Manually installing maxima on debian-based systems</h3>
<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/maxima/files/Maxima-Linux/">Maxima-Linux</a>
Contains <em>.deb</em> files that can be downloaded and manually
installed on debian-based systems.</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>maxima-common</em> contains many files needed in order to
  run and install the actual maxima binary.</li>
  <li><em>maxima-sbcl</em> provides a maxima binary that was compiled
  with sbcl.  It should be reasonably fast and able to run even on
  systems with no sbcl installed.</li>
  <li><em>maxima-gcl</em> provides a maxima binary that was compiled
  with gcl.  It might be considerably faster or slower than sbcl,
  depending on the task.</li>
  <li><em>maxima-ecl</em> provides a maxima binary that was compiled
  with ecl.  Performance-wise it normally ranges between clisp and
  sbcl.</li>
  <li><em>maxima-clisp</em> provides a maxima binary that was compiled
  with clisp.  It should be extremely memory-efficient and able to run
  on every system that has a similar clisp to that maxima was compiled
  with installed.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be able to run Maxima, both <em>maxima-common</em> and at least
one of the above binaries have to be installed.  Most systems contain
a program that automatically installs <em>.deb</em> packages on
double-clicking them. If that isn't the case the following command
will install packages:</p>
<pre>sudo dpkg -i &lt;packagename&gt;</pre>
<p>If dpkg claims that some dependencies aren't fulfilled the required
packages an automatic install and download of these can be triggered
by issuing the following command:</p>
<pre>sudo apt-get -f install</pre>
<h3>Distribution-independent packages</h3>
<p>Maxima is also part of the
distribution-independent <a href="https://uappexplorer.com/snap/ubuntu/wxmaxima">
snap package</a> of wxMaxima. Informations about installing snaps can
be
found <a href="https://snapcraft.io/docs/core/install">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Android</h3>
<p>The download instructions and links can be found in
the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/maximaonandroid/">Maxima on
Android</a> page.</p>
<h3>Source Code</h3>
<p>In systems not included in the previous list or if you want to
build a more recent Maxima version or with a different Lisp flavor,
get the source code from
the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/maxima/files/Maxima-source/">Maxima-source</a>
subsection. Unpack the file and follow the instructions given in
file <code>INSTALL</code>, which can also
be <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/code/ci/master/tree/INSTALL">read
on-line</a>.</p>
<h3>GIT</h3>
<p>The most recent development version of the source code can be
downloaded from
the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/code/ci/master/tree/">GIT
repository</a>. That page shows the git command that should be used to
obtain a complete copy of the repository. After getting the code,
follow the instructions
in <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/code/ci/master/tree/INSTALL.git">INSTALL.git</a>.</p>
<h3>Nightly builds</h3>
<p>For Windows a nightly build can be downloaded
from <a href="https://wolfgang.dautermann.at/maxima/nightlybuild/">Wolfgang
Dautermann's Website</a> that also provides detailed results of
compilation and testbench runs on many different lisps. For Ubuntu
Linux nightly builds of maxima are provided
at <a href="https://code.launchpad.net/~maxima-developers/+archive/ubuntu/maxima-nightly/">launchpad.net</a>.</p>
<p>If the <a href="apt://snapd">snappy apps infrastructure</a> is
installed (Info on installing it manually
is<a href="https://snapcraft.io/docs/core/install">here</a>) the
following command installs a distribution-independent, though large
nightly build of maxima + wxMaxima on entering the following
command:</p>
<pre>sudo snap install --edge wxmaxima</pre>
<p>Even if there is no guarantee that a nightly build will work, the
Maxima team tries to keep its codebase as stable as possible which
means that if something is broken in the nightly build which did work
in the release this information normally is important for the
developers.</p>
<h3>Front-ends</h3>
<p>The <em>Xmaxima</em> and <em>Imaxima</em> interfaces are part of
the Maxima project and they come included with Maxima. The links to
download other independent front-ends can be found in
the <a href="relatedprojects.html">Projects Related to Maxima</a>
section.</p>
