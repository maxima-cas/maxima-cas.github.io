<p>Dear Dr. Schelter:</p>
<p>RE: DOE-MACSYMA</p>
<p>This is in reply to your request of September 17, 1998, requesting
a license to prepare and distribute derivative works from the copy of
DOE-MACSYMA software obtained from the NESC. The ESTSC assumed the DOE
Centralized Software Management Facility responsibility in January
1991. The following statement of the Department of Energy's (DOE)
position is provided as the ESTSC response to your request.</p>
<p>“<cite>It has been the DOE practice (where the case permits) to
encourage private companies or individuals to modify, enhance, or make
derivative works of unrestricted software sponsored or supported by
DOE for the purpose of commercialization or distribution of such
modifications, enhancements, and/or derivative works. Accordingly,
William F. Schelter may consider he has a nonexclusive, world-wide,
royalty-free license to make derivative works (modifications or
enhancements) from the copy of DOE-MACSYMA obtained from NESC, and to
copy, license and/or distribute those derivative works for use,
modification and enhancement, and further sublicensing and
distribution.</cite></p>
<p><cite>Distribution of such derivative works is subject to the
U.S. Export Administration Regulations (Title 15 CFR 768-799), which
implements the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, and/or
the International Traffic in Arms Regulation, of 12-6-84, (Title 22
CFR 121-130), which implements the Arms Export Control Act (22
U.S.C. 2728) and may require license for export.</cite>”</p>
<p>We have enclosed a current list of the countries which are
considered sensitive and require approval through DOE
Headquarters. Should you have requests from such countries, please
contact the ESTSC for approval. If you intend to make your derivative
work(s) available under the GPL (gnu public license) via the Internet,
the previous paragraph should be included in the GPL and should
accompany other modifications, enhancements or derivative works of
your program.</p>
<p>The derivative versions of DOE-MACSYMA which you develop for
commercialization purposes may be of interest to DOE organizations
which ESTSC supports. We would appreciate getting copies of such
derivatives and would adhere to the dissemination limitation markings
which you define.</p>
<p>If you have questions or comments, please call me at 423/576-2606.</p>
