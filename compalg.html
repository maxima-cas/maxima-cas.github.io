<h2>Computer Algebra Systems</h2>
<p>A computer algebra system (CAS) is a software package with the
ability to manipulate mathematical expressions in a way similar to the
way a scientist would do calculations on paper.</p>
<p>A list of the most important Computer Algebra Systems and their
features can be found in the
Wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_computer_algebra_systems">List
of computer algebra systems</a>. Here we are concerned only with Free
systems, such as Maxima, where the algorithms used can be found in the
source code, allowing other people to study them, adapt them, modify them
and reuse them.</p>

<h3>Other Free Computer Algebra Systems</h3>
<h4><a href="http://axiom-developer.org/">Axiom</a></h4>
<p>“Axiom is a general purpose q Computer Algebra system. It is useful
for doing mathematics by computer and for research and development of
mathematical algorithms. It defines a strongly typed, mathematically
correct type hierarchy. It has a programming language and a built-in
compiler.”</p> <p>There is also an
interesting <a href="https://github.com/daly/PDFS/blob/master/rosetta.pdf">Rosetta
Stone</a> which offers translations of many basic operations for
several computer algebra systems, including Maxima.</p>
<h4><a href="http://www.gap-system.org/">GAP</a></h4>
<p>“GAP is a system for computational discrete algebra, with
particular emphasis on Computational Group
Theory.”</p>
<h4><a href="http://webuser.hs-furtwangen.de/~dersch">Jasymca</a></h4>
<p>“Jasymca is a symbolic calculator written for mobile phones and
PDAs. It solves and manipulates equations, handles basic calculus
problems, and provides a few more typical functions of computer
algebra systems. The syntax is loosely related to Maxima.”</p>
<h4><a href="http://reduce-algebra.com">REDUCE</a></h4>
<p>“REDUCE is an interactive system for general algebraic computations
of interest to mathematicians, scientists and engineers.”</p>
<h4><a href="http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/">SINGULAR</a></h4>
<p>“SINGULAR is a Computer Algebra System for polynomial computations
with special emphasis on the needs of commutative algebra, algebraic
geometry, and singularity theory.”</p>
<h4><a href="http://yacas.sourceforge.net/">Yacas</a></h4>
<p>“YACAS is an easy to use, general purpose Computer Algebra System,
a program for symbolic manipulation of mathematical expressions. It
uses its own programming language designed for symbolic as well as
arbitrary-precision numerical computations.”</p>

<h3>Other Free Mathematical Software</h3>
<p>Extensive lists of packages can be found
in <a href="http://orms.mfo.de/">Oberwolfach References on
Mathematical Software</a> and
the <a href="https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Category/Mathematics">Free
mathematical and computational software directory</a></p>
<p>Here we highlight the ones that we consider more relevant to
Maxima:</p>
<h4><a href="http://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~forster/sw/aribas.html">ARIBAS</a></h4>
<p>“ARIBAS is an interactive interpreter q for big integer arithmetic
and multi-precision floating point arithmetic with a Pascal/Modula
like syntax. It has several builtin functions for algorithmic number
theory like gcd, Jacobi symbol, Rabin probabilistic prime test,
factorization algorithms (Pollard rho, elliptic curve, continued
fraction, quadratic sieve), etc.”</p>
<h4><a href="http://www.numpy.org/">NumPy</a></h4>
<p>“The fundamental package needed for scientific computing with
Python is called NumPy. This package contains a powerful N-dimensional
array object, sophisticated (broadcasting) functions, tools for
integrating C/C++ and Fortran code, and useful linear algebra, Fourier
transform, and random number capabilities.”</p>
<h4><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">Octave</a></h4>
<p>“GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for
numerical computations. It provides a convenient command line
interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and
for performing other numerical experiments using a language that is
mostly compatible with Matlab.”</p>
<h4><a href="http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/">PARI/GP</a></h4>
<p>“PARI/GP is a widely used computer algebra system designed for fast
computations in number theory (factorizations, algebraic number
theory, elliptic curves...), but also contains a large number of other
useful functions to compute with mathematical entities such as
matrices, polynomials, power series, algebraic numbers etc., and a lot
of transcendental functions.”</p>
<h4><a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a></h4>
<p>“R is a free software environment for statistical computing and
graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms,
Windows and MacOS.”</p>
