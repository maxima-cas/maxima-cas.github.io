<h2>Maxima and Lisp</h2>
<p>Maxima is written in the computer language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a>. In a Maxima session the
user can enter individual Lisp commands using the prefix “<code>:lisp</code>”,
as in the following example:
<div class="maxima">
<span class="maxlabel">(%i1)</span> :lisp (+ 2/7 (* 3 4 1/5))<br>
94/35
</div>
<p>The user can also start a Lisp session from Maxima with the
command <code>to_lisp()</code>. And that Lisp session can be ended,
returning to Maxima, with the Lisp
command <code>(to-maxima)</code>. See more details in
the <a href="docs/manual/maxima_166.html">Lisp and Maxima</a> section
of the reference manual.</p>

<h3>Lisp Implementations of Maxima</h3>
<p>Maxima can be compiled with SBCL, Clisp, CCL, GCL, CMUCL, ECL,
Scieneer Common Lisp (SCL), Allegro Common Lisp (ACL) and ABCL.</p>
<p>Ports to other ANSI Common Lisps should be straightforward and are
welcome; please post a message on the <a href="maximalist.html">Maxima
mailing list</a> if you are interested in working on a port.</p>
<p>When Maxima is compiled, the Lisp implementation is selected by
giving to the configure script an argument of the
form <code>--enable-foolisp</code>, where &quot;foolisp&quot; is the
name of the Lisp implementation. <code>./configure --help</code> shows
a list of the Lisp implementations accepted by <code>configure</code>
(among other options). Always specify the Lisp type; configure tries
to autodetect the Lisp type if it is not specified, but it has been
reported that autodetection can fail.</p>
<p>The compiled Maxima image can also be made executable (embedding an
autonomous copy of the Lisp program used), when Clisp, SBCL or CMUCL
are used. To build an executable image, the suffix <code>-exec</code>
should be appended to the option <code>--enable-foolisp</code> given
to the <code>configure</code> program.</p>
<p>There are various differences among different Lisp implementations,
regarding speed, memory usage, error handling, support for foreign
functions interface (FFI) and command line editing. Some
implementations use the GNU readline library, which provides the
ability to recall previously used commands and edit them. For the
implementations that do not have that ability, Maxima includes
the <code>rmaxima</code> front-end which provides advanced
line-editing facilities
via <a href="https://github.com/hanslub42/rlwrap">rlwrap</a>.</p>
<h4 id="SBCL">SBCL</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.sbcl.org/">Steel Bank Common Lisp</a> (SBCL),
is a fork of CMUCL which differs in some minor details, but most
notably, it is simpler to rebuild SBCL than CMUCL. There are SBCL
implementations for Linux, several BSD systems, Solaris, Mac OS X and
MS Windows.</p>
<p><code>rmaxima</code> is recommended for use with SBCL.</p>
<h4 id="Clisp">Clisp</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.clisp.org/">Clisp</a> can be built
with <code>readline</code> support, so Maxima has advanced
command-line editing facilities when built with it.</p>
<p>Clisp is compiled to bytecodes, so Maxima running on Clisp is
substantially slower than on Lisps compiled to machine
instructions. On the other hand, Clisp contains code
from <a href="http://www.ginac.de/CLN/">CLN</a>, a library for
efficient computations with all kinds of numbers in arbitrary
precision.</p>
<p>There are Clisp implementations for many platforms including MS
Windows and Unix-like systems.</p>
<h4 id="GCL">GCL</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcl/">GCL</a> versions
starting with 2.4.3 can be built with <code>readline</code> support,
so Maxima has advanced command-line editing facilities when built with
it. GCL produces a fast Maxima executable.</p>
<p>Only the ANSI-enabled version of GCL works with Maxima; thus, when
GCL is built, it must be configured with
the <code>--enable-ansi</code> flag, i.e., execute <code>./configure
--enable-ansi</code> in the build directory before
executing <code>make</code>. Whether GCL is ANSI-enabled or not can be
determined by inspecting the banner which is printed when GCL is
executed; if ANSI-enabled, the banner should say ”ANSI”.  Also, the
special variable <code>*FEATURES*</code> should include the
keyword <code>:ANSI-CL</code>.</p>
<p>There are GCL implementations for many platforms including MS
Windows and Unix-like systems.</p>
<h4 id="CCL">CCL</h4>
<p><a href="http://ccl.clozure.com/">Clozure Common Lisp</a>, or CCL
for short, was formerly known as OpenMCL. It is available for Linux,
MS Windows and Macintosh and Maxima can be compiled with it.</p>
<h4 id="CMUCL">CMUCL</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.cons.org/cmucl/">CMUCL</a> is a fast option for
Maxima on platforms where it is available. CMUCL versions 18e and 19a
are known to work. There are CMUCL implementations only for Unix-like
systems (not MS Windows).</p>
<p><code>rmaxima</code> is recommended for use with CMUCL.</p>
<h4 id="ECL">ECL</h4>
<p><a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/ecl/">ECL</a> is a small
but complete implementation of Common Lisp. The Android port of Maxima
is currently built with ECL.</p>
<h4 id="SCL">SCL and Allegro CL</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.scieneer.com/scl/">Scieneer Common Lisp</a>
(SCL) is a fast option for Maxima for a range of Linux and Unix
platforms. <a href="https://franz.com/products/allegrocl/">Allegro
Common Lisp</a> is an object-oriented system. The SCL 1.2.8 release
and later are supported. SCL offers a lower case, case sensitive,
version which avoids the Maxima case inversion issues with symbol
names. Maxima can be compiled with these two Lisp implementations, but
only limited testing has been since they are commercial non-free
software.</p>
<h4 id="ABCL"></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.abcl.org/">ABCL</a> is a full implementation
of the Common Lisp language featuring both an interpreter and a
compiler, running in the JVM.</p>
